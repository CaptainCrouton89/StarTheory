Energy builds up each turn. Rate of energy growth can be upgraded as well. Using stuff requires energy.
Most things also have cooldowns, though these can be lowered. Each turn is 10 ticks go by, and each item have cooldowns ranging from 10-100 ticks.
Each item has a cool down listed next to it saying how many ticks it has left before it can be used again. This can also be upgraded. 
Turns are taken simultaneously. Faster speeds mean your attack happens first. You can use all your energy each turn, it regenerates at set speed.
Can get batteries to save up left over. Choose a number of attacks up to amount of energy you have available. 
Tweaks can be installed on modules to lower cool downs, change energy costs, or increase potency (damage/effectiveness).
You have 4 defense stats, health stat, and an energy stat
the 4 defense stats slowly regenerate due to crew repairs, though you can prioritize one over the others (determined by how many crew you have)
When enemies reach 10%(maybe 15%?) hp, the ship surrenders (space ships are expensive, and new ones are even more so). 
You can choose to take all their cargo and ransom crew, or blow it up (in which case you can't take anything from them). Can't take actual credits, in da bank.
However, you may surrender any time you want, in which case they take all your cargo. However, if you drop to 0 HP, your ship blows up. 
You and your crew escape in your escape pod, where you are picked up by the enemy and ransomed back to your faction. You lose honor/reknown, get your ship back,
but go into large debt to your faction. If it gets too high, you are outlawed from landing on that faction's planets.

Crews are TWEAKS!!! Different crew give different bonuses to different modules, and not all were created equal. Some better at repairs,
others better at efficieny, potency, or cooldowns. 


Weapons require certain cool down, also must be manned, and have energy? Too many. Cool down will go down only if manned? You have 10 
energy, max of 15, gain 5 each turn. Lets say that basic weapon uses 7, one turn cooldown, so you could do nothing now and attack with it 
twice next turn? No because has cool down, max rate is once per turn. Idea: Most defenses regenerate quite quickly, so you want to stack 
things in a row to deal more damage? But then you get same sequence of things done over and overâ€”attack with weapons 1, 2, then attack with
weapon 4 and 3 next turn. Then wait one turn for everything to max out, then repeat. Unless different stats regain at different speeds? Maybe
Regenerate not fixed amount, but a percentage, like 20% of it's max, which means targetting high level of one defense is gonna be really hard
so it discourages that. Could also be under user control? like, could direct crew to different stats? WOuld start as automatic, all get auto 
regenerated, with lowest one being priority, but that could be overridden by user if they wanted to. New Idea: Each crew member contributes 
exactly 2% to that defense's regen rate, meaning more crew means more regen? Or instead, each member contributes 20 points of regeneration 
per turn, so that max crews aren't OP. If you start with crew of one, ideally, then you can regenerate 20% of one stat per turn, solid. 


"defenses on board your ship are composed of a multitude of things, including hull armor, insulations, energy shields, and reflection panels. 
You have a variety of different types of defenses that are represeneted. The types of defenses each correspond to a type of damage, 
and are particularly strong against that type of defense. However, these stats can be changed by damage from weapons, often times not of the type 
that they are specifically strong against"


Speed makes it take more turns to fire. Can avert power to defense that needs regen. Lets you sync attacks. Can avert some ene
